# Introduction 🚀
Sales analysis is crucial for understanding the performance of a business, identifying trends, and making informed decisions to optimize sales strategies. This project aims to analyze sales data to uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights.

# Data Sources 📂
The sales data collected for this analysis contains information such as sales transactions, product details, customer geographical details.

The data for the first half of the year (January to June) was collected in excel and saved as csv files before management decided to use databases to store their data. The first six (6) months of the data was located on OneDrive while the last six (6) months was  in a remote database.

 # Methodology
CRISP-DM Framework 🔄
This project follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, which consists of the following six phases:

Business Understanding 💼🔍 
Data Understanding 📊💡 
Data Preparation 🛠️🧹 
Modeling 🤖📈 
Evaluation 📝🔍 
Deployment 🚀📊

It is worthy to mention that with the exception of the modelling phase all other phases were used in this project. This is because the project's focus did not require modelling.


# Analysis 🔍
The analysis consists of several key steps:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw sales data for analysis, including handling missing values, data formatting, and data transformation.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the sales data to understand its distribution, trends, and relationships between variables. This includes visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

Sales Performance Metrics: Calculating key sales performance metrics such as total sales revenue, average order value, total quantity ordered and total unique product.

Segment Analysis: Analyzing sales performance by different segments such as product categories, customer segments.



# Results 📈
The analysis reveals insights such as:

- There are no missing values for order IDs, as the count matches the total number of rows in the dataset
- The minimum quantity ordered is 1, and the maximum is 9, with the majority of transactions having a quantity ordered of 1 as indicated by the median and quartiles.
- The mean price of each item ordered is approximately $184.52, with a standard deviation of $332.84, indicating significant variability in item prices.
- The total amount of money made in 2019 was $16,513,908.56
- The minimum quantity ordered is 1, and the maximum is 9, with the majority of transactions having a quantity ordered of 1 as indicated by the median and quartiles.
