# Introduction 🚀
Sales analysis is crucial for understanding the performance of a business, identifying trends, and making informed decisions to optimize sales strategies. This project aims to analyze sales data to uncover patterns, correlations, and actionable insights.

# Data Sources 📂
The sales data collected for this analysis contains information such as sales transactions, product details, and customer geographical details.

The data for the first half of the year (January to June) was collected in Excel and saved as CSV files before management decided to use databases to store their data from July to December. So we had the first six (6) months of the data located on OneDrive while the last six (6) months were  in a remote database.

 # Methodology
CRISP-DM Framework 🔄
This project follows the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) framework, which consists of the following six phases:

Business Understanding 💼🔍 
Data Understanding 📊💡 
Data Preparation 🛠️🧹 
Modeling 🤖📈 
Evaluation 📝🔍 
Deployment 🚀📊

It is worth mentioning that except for the modeling and Evaluation phases, all other phases were used in this project. This is because the project's focus did not require modeling, in effect there has not been any evaluation of any model.
